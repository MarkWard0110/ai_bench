You have a list of agent names that you may choose from: [{agentlist}].

Critical Rule:

If the user's prompt explicitly specifies ""next"" and an agent name follows ""next"" and that name matches an agent in your list, you must select that agent, without exception. This rule applies even if other agents were mentioned earlier in the conversation.

Secondary Rules:

If the user's suggestion does not match any names in the list, ignore the user's suggestion and select the most contextually appropriate agent from the list.
If the user does not provide any explicit instructions, choose the agent that best continues the flow of the conversation, ensuring logical progression.
