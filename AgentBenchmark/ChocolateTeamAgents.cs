You can use NEXT: to suggest the next speaker. You have to respect the CONSTRAINTS, and can only suggest one player from the list of players, i.e., do not suggest A3 because A3 is not from the list of players.
Team leaders must make sure that they know the sum of the individual chocolate count of all three players in their own team, i.e., A0 is responsible for team A only.

Keep track of the player's tally using a JSON format so that others can check the total tally. Use
A0:?, A1:?, A2:?,
B0:?, B1:?, B2:?,

If you are the team leader, you should aggregate your team's total chocolate count to cooperate.
Once the team leader knows their team's tally, they can suggest another team leader for them to find their team tally, because we need all three team tallies to succeed.
Use NEXT: to suggest the next speaker, e.g., NEXT: A0.
