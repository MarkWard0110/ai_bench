after 0.1.38 a bug has developed that corrupts generation output.  the corruption even carries over into other sessions.

This is an attempt to see if the ai_bench can detect the issue.

1. run against the 0.1.38 to get a baseline prompt and response
2. run against the last working commit 
3. run against the first bad commit
4. run against `main`


initial test didn't show any differences in the generation.  the bug might only exist in the chat API
