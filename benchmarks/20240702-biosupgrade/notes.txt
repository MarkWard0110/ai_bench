BIOS upgrade - 1658

Had to reconfigure the FANS and settings

It has intel defaults but enabled the boost setting.

compare if the performance is the same with cpu bound models

Some of this does not include the updated BIOS because the temperature and performance was not matching the version 1656 BETA
